#Description
If you grep logs, look for response and request, then unescape json-strings, then prettify and e.t.c. This package is for you :)

#Installation
```shell
npm install split-payload
```

#Usage
```shell
zgrep YOUR_REQUEST_ID YOUR_PAYLOAD_ARCHIVE.gz | split-payload
```
As a result you get two files with prettified JSON in the current directory: request.json and response.json.
